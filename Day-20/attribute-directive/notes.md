# Angular - Day 4 - Attribute Directive
- Change the appearance or behavior of an element, component, or another directive.
- Attribute directives listen to and modify the behavior of other HTML elements, attributes, properties, and components.
- Many attribute directives are defined through modules such as the `CommonModule`, `RouterModule` and `FormsModule`.

- The most common attribute directives are as follows:
    - `ngClass` : Adds and removes a set of CSS classes.
    - `ngStyle` : Adds and removes a set of HTML styles.
    - `ngModel` : Adds two-way data binding to an HTML form element.
